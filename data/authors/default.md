Hi, my name is Yingshi. I'm a master's student at Cornell University. My current focus is in visual computing. I also have interests in full stack development and web3.

Here is my story in the past five years and how it leads to my transition into software engineering.

I love to explore different opportunities. While I was studing at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, I had 6 internships in 3 different cities. Since I was in an interdisciplinary major (because I'm not sure of what I'll end up doing in the future), my internship experiences are extremely diverse:

In 2017, my first internship was in a VC firm. I had a chance to interview startup founders with awesome business ideas. I also wrote my first web scraping script in Python to collect public information about startups and investing institutions and put them into a 20 pages venture capital landscape report.

Also in 2017, I worked part-time for a fintech startup. I wrote Python scripts to perform technical analyses on stock prices and analyze stock returns.

2018 is a fruitful year, and I took a Gap from school. I started with an internship as an investment analyst. After three months, I exchanged to Germany. I took master-level CS courses, and traveled to 11 countries in Europe during weekends and holidays. When I came back, I spent a half-year internship in the Strategy Department of Tencent AI Lab, meanwhile forming my startup team and competing in entrepreneurship competition. It was frustrating in the process of finding people to build out the prototype, and I started to do the software development by myself.

Also in 2018, I started to ask myself: after I have tried so many career options, which choice can support my enduring interests in learning new things, and building applications that can have an impact on society?

In 2019, I was preparing for my final career transition in my life: I got admitted to the master's program at Cornell University's College of Computing and Information Science. I also won the Outstanding Capstone Project Award for my final year software development project with Bloomberg H.K.

In 2020, I started my internship at Societe Generale as a Software Engineer. My project was to build an anomaly detection tool to detect human mistakes in calculating market risk charts.

Until 2021 June, I was working in an Autonomous Driving startup in Beijing.
